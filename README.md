### About Project
This is my personal portfolio website I created. The design of this website was created as a part of Bina Nusantara Computer Club (BNCC) UI/UX class final project for getting the certificate of completion. After I finished the class, and right now is the summer vacation, I want to create the website version of this design, and also as a part of my training to become a frontend web developer so I created this project.
